Scrum 1 Summary (03/02/20)

Opening:

  Scrum master (Jason) briefly covered the feedback given from sprint 1, reminding the group of the information covered in the sprint 1 retrospective. "Aims for Sprint 2" were talked about, ensuring everybody was on the same page for what we need to do differently in this sprint. 
  Brief overview of feedback from client meeting was also covered. 

Jason:

  Have done:
    Started writing tests for allowing the user to change the fint, increasing the accessibility of our solution
  Will do:
    Implement the font changing functionality, as well as hoping to look into other ways of making the user interface more accessible. Will also look into using XUnit within Windows Forms, so to improve the unit testing
   
Melvin:

  Have done:
    Typed up the burndown chart and inputted the user stories, as well as breaking down the user stories into tasks to be completed. Also carried out research on how to find the users live location
  Will do:
    Find a way of the live location and changing this into an address for us to use in our solution. Next steps would be helping to implement this
  
Lin:

  Have done:
    Looked into redesigning the user interface, and crceating rough sketches to reflect this.
  Will do:
    Give the user interface redesign a more polished look, as well as looking into the functionality behind swapping between pages
  
Paul:

  Have done:
    Completed test plan for search procedure. Once implemented, this will allow the user to search for procedures by a description, instead of the medical code
  Will do:
    Implement the given tests, and work towards providing this as a completed solution
  
Kyle:

  Have done:
    Researched how to display search results in a list box, in an effort to clean up this section (as asked by clients in the client meeting)
  Will do:
  Implement the list box feature, as well researching and implementing a method of allowing the user to select one of the returned  options
  
Arran:

  Have done:
    Began spike project researching how to find the distance between two points in the map. 
  Will do:
    Research into finding routes between points, as this will help in finding the distance. Then can work with Kyle to use the hospital address data to find the distance between those and the point given by the user. 
  
Closing:

  Reminding the group to help eachother where possible. If you find a resource that may be helpful to others, share it on the Slack. Examples of this already happening were given (Arran sharing map resources to Melvin, Jason sharing unit testing resources).
