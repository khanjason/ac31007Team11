Scrum 1 Summary (03/02/20)

Opening:

  Scrum master (Jason) briefly covered the feedback given from sprint 1, reminding the group of the information covered in the sprint 1 retrospective. "Aims for Sprint 2" were talked about, ensuring everybody was on the same page for what we need to do differently in this sprint. 
  Brief overview of feedback from client meeting was also covered. 

Jason:

  Have done:
    Started writing tests for allowing the user to change the fint, increasing the accessibility of our solution
  Will do:
    Implement the font changing functionality, as well as hoping to look into other ways of making the user interface more accessible. Will also look into using XUnit within Windows Forms, so to improve the unit testing
   
Melvin:

  Have done:
    Typed up the burndown chart and inputted the user stories, as well as breaking down the user stories into tasks to be completed. Also carried out research on how to find the users live location
  Will do:
    Find a way of the live location and changing this into an address for us to use in our solution. Next steps would be helping to implement this
  
Lin:

  Have done:
    Looked into redesigning the user interface, and crceating rough sketches to reflect this.
  Will do:
    Give the user interface redesign a more polished look, as well as looking into the functionality behind swapping between pages
  
Paul:

  Have done:
    Completed test plan for search procedure. Once implemented, this will allow the user to search for procedures by a description, instead of the medical code
  Will do:
    Implement the given tests, and work towards providing this as a completed solution
  
Kyle:

  Have done:
    Researched how to display search results in a list box, in an effort to clean up this section (as asked by clients in the client meeting)
  Will do:
  Implement the list box feature, as well researching and implementing a method of allowing the user to select one of the returned  options
  
Arran:

  Have done:
    Began spike project researching how to find the distance between two points in the map. 
  Will do:
    Research into finding routes between points, as this will help in finding the distance. Then can work with Kyle to use the hospital address data to find the distance between those and the point given by the user. 
  
Closing:

  Reminding the group to help eachother where possible. If you find a resource that may be helpful to others, share it on the Slack. Examples of this already happening were given (Arran sharing map resources to Melvin, Jason sharing unit testing resources). 
  
  
Scrum 2 (04/02/20)

Jason:

  Have done:
    Worked on adding accessibility features. Tests have been written, and basic methods created. Also done some work trying to implement continuous integration using GitHub workflow, but ran into problems and couldn't complete this. 
  Will do:
    Need to combine the accessibility features into the final UI. Can do this once map functionality and UI are finalised
  Problems:
    Having trouble with the CI in GitHub workflows, YML script fails to build the solution. This has put to the side to hopefull come back to later. 
    
Melvin:

  Have done:
    Working functionality using the users live location, taking in the GPS of the current device. This returns a latitude and longitude, which can later be used with the map features
  Will do:
    Update sprint backlog with the teams work from today, and combine live location functionality with map once it has been finalised. 

Paul:

  Have done:
    Completed tests for the search functionality, and written the code to pass the tests. Matches are returned as a list
  Will do:
    Need to combine this functionality with the UI once finalised by Lin
  Problems:
    
Arran:

  Have done:
    Finished spike research about finding distance between points. Have also finished research with creating routes between two points on the map, and displaying these. Tests have begun to be written for adding this function
  Will do:
    Finish tests and implement routing feature. Work with Kyle to combine routing with the hospital addresses returned by his search procedure
    
Lin:

Have done:
  Finished design of UI, and started implementing this into a windows forms application
Will do:
  Once this is finished, will need to take feedback from the team to ensure UI is suitable for each aspect of the product. May need to change parts, depending on how the team feels
